## What is

[Local.gd](https://local.gd/) is a service that resolve every url as `127.0.0.1`.  
Use **mysite.local.gd** when developing locally and it'll resolve to **127.0.0.1** just like magic!  
Any subdomain like *.local.gd will work.

This mean if you call `cluster.local.gd` the browser call the 127.0.0.1

This is very usefull when you want test a cluster o services in your machine and dont want change the `/etc/hosts` or install `dnsmasq` service.

## Configuration

There is 0 configuration. Just call the `<name>`.local.gd
